# Why Surveillance Advertising is evil
- Mass surveillance with no oversight has been achieved already
  - *leave no doubt that the things I'm talking about are not hypotheticals but real issues that exist today*
- The government now has a vested interest in keeping the web concentrated into a few large companies they can control
  - *There is a techno-libertarian angle here that I should cautiously play into*
  - *Maybe form a hypothesis here about why a decentralized web has not emerged*
  - It's a 2 way street. The incumbent tech giants get lobbying power out of it and are allowed to
  merge and acquire without impediment from the federal government
- It adds an unacceptable amount of bloat to web pages, which is an environmental concern
  - *Here we can hook a lot of people with the broadly known moral dilemma of environmental concerns*
  - *This is also a chance to add some hard numbers*
- It is opaque to users. People are creeped out by it because they fundamentally don't understand how it works or the extent to which they are being surveilled.
  - *Here we can be anecdotal and relate to a lot of experiences that have become commonplace
    - e.g. talking aloud about something and then being shown ads for it*
- It is an industry built on bending the truth
  - *Maybe talk here about historical restrictions on advertising and how they are being subverted*
- It has large potential for abuse as a propaganda machine
  - *Here we can make note of history and how propaganda is inherently perceived as negative in the US*
- *At some point in this opening we need to address common retorts*
  - What do you have to hide? 
    - Point to the propaganda machine, relate to fears of scarlet lettering of coronavirus victims
  - No one can do things as well as ${fav-tech-giant}
    - This is more of a defense of technocracy and big business than it is of surveillance advertising. It just posits that one is not possible without the other. While I believe both are bad, it is a mistake to assume that Google could not exist without ubiquitous surveillance. For a different essay, we can talk about how Amazon could be broken up and still serve all the needs of its customers.
  - I would rather have targeted ads than untargeted ads, they are more relevant.
    - The choice is not between relevant and unrelevant, but between hyper-relevant and also they are surveilling you vs relevant based on the content of the page you are on and they don't get to surveill you.
    - Targeted ads are often based on weak inference logic. I see ads because they *think* I may be a likely buyer based on everything else they know about me. This gets my interests very wrong a lot of the time, but no one seems to talk about it.
  - There are no good replacements for (gmail, google docs, IG, FB, Amazon, etc..)
    - Well I wonder why? See symbiotic government/corporate surveillance points above
    - There is no *technical* reason that someone couldn't run a gmail clone that just charges a nominal fee instead of tracking you. You can host one yourself if you are savvy enough. 
      - *Maybe list some alternatives here*

# My experience in advertising
- At first I was lying to clients about our capabilities, which was fine because I didn't want 
my company to have said capabilities.
- Then we acquired Epsilon and we gained some of those capabilities in the US. Now the problem was
not lying to clients but lying to the public.
- Product managers (and the vast majority of the company) not allowed to see behind the curtain
- Shady data dealers

# Why I stayed for so long even though I knew it was hypocritical
- My hypocrisy
  - I run an ad blocker
  - I believe the moral arguments listed above
  - I knew within a year that my company was slimy
- They paid well, with good benefits and health insurance
  - Time to note here that employment based health insurance is evil
- I had an exit point in my mind
  - Early retirement
    - It felt noble to save my money, to be responsible where so many including the federal government were not
    - Once I had saved enough money to not have to work then I wouldn't have to work for evil companies and I could be more picky
    - This is horse shit
    - I compromised my morals for the idea of an easier life based on acquiring an amount of financial resources that most people never will.
    - I made myself think everything is fine because this goal seems so attainable to me
    - I wanted to essentially be a bottom dweller of the ruling class
      - *Should make more effort to define the ruling class here*

# A new plan
  - Work should not be avoided. I will largely be judged at my funeral by the work I have done to help others. 
  - If my plan was to make enough money so that I could help people without worrying about financial security then my priorities were backwards
    - I should help people first and worry about money second.
  - If I fundamentally recuse myself from the working world with early retirement than I have forsaken any hope of solidarity with the people I claim to want to help
  - Early retirement can still be a great thing. Less financial obligations does mean that I can focus more on helping people. However, I should not compromise my morals to do so, and I should not use some vague notion of future ability to do good to justify doing wrong right here and now.

## *Potential prompt for another article* 
- Are network effects inherently evil? What's the difference between a network effect and an anticompetitive monopoly. How do venture funded firms seek to leverage the prior into the latter. 
- What to do about it? Can simple regulations like forced interoperability save us from the common scenario where a single entity controls an entire network and all the market power that comes with it?
  - simple regulations
    - no loopholes or edge cases
    - low potential for court battles over the meaning or enforcement policy
