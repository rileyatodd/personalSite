# Phone Customization

## Distraction reducers
- Nova launcher 
  - removes swipe left for google news
  - only show calendar on home screen, no app shortcuts
- turn off fingerprint unlock
  - prevent mindlessly looking at phone by requiring at least the effort to input lock code/pattern
- don't install/uninstall social media apps
  - you don't have to delete your account to unchain your mind from it. Just make sure it's not so close at hand. Facebook and instagram have desktop sites that work just fine. Make sure to explicitly log off and close the tab after using one of these so that you're forced to expend effort to look at it again.
- Do not disturb
  - Scheduled for work and sleep hours, with exceptions for repeat calls or important contacts

## Combatting Google's monopoly
- remove google search bar to combat their monopoly and help with privacy
- install firefox
  - both for enhanced privacy and to combat Google's monopolies
