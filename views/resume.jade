          I'm building a global marketing platform to help clients develop insights about their customers. I've architected our Angular UI, driven features from the data modeling phase through delivery of a polished interface, revamped the security controls, and transformed the application from a frail monolith to a resilient, distributed system that is deployed in eight configurations across three continents.

        p.
          In addition to developing new features, I focus on security, reliability, and automation. It used to take two days to provision the infrastructure for a new instance of the application. I automated that processes using ansible and cloudformation and now it takes two hours. I saw that our teams were wasting effort writing similar code for each service, so I extracted common code to a shared client library. Our ingress policies were poorly defined until I implemented an API gateway to handle all incoming traffic. When our team members struggled to follow requests through our distributed architecture, I added standardized logging, monitoring, and tracing to improve visibility. I've refactored misguided data models, improved our continuous integration pipeline, implemented single sign on via ADFS, and built rich interfaces and data visualizations. Overcoming this wide array of challenges has been very satisfying.

          I created new features on both a public php site with over a million users and an internal analytics platform built in Java using the Spring framework.

          I created a risk assessment application using Angular, Spring, and PostgreSQL that automated a months long analysis so that it could be done in a matter of days.
