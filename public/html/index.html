I am still working on adding content and polishing the design.</i></p><h1>Thoughts</h1><h3>Learning to Love the Language of the Web</h3><p>I'm really really starting to like javascript.</p><p>Like many other people I have talked to, when I first started learning JS I continuously found myself wondering how anyone uses this language productively. However, after embracing the functional aspects of the language rather than trying to squish it messily into the object oriented paradigms I was used to, my enjoyment of this language has improved dramatically and my code is cleaner too. A big part of this was reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742">JavaScript: The Good Parts</a>, which has helped me avoid the many common pitfalls of JavaScript such as global variables. It was also helpful in understanding the prototypal inheritance system of JavaScript as opposed to the classical inheritance I was used to from Java. 
</p><p>In the span of just a few weeks JavaScript has gone from something I reluctantly used for front end programming to something I find myself actually <em>wanting</em> to program in. I've since begun to immerse myself in the vibrant JavaScript ecosystem. Tools such as <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>, which I used on a recent <a href="/chicago-food-safety">project</a>, have really impressed me with the way they allow you to build rich client-side single page apps out of small, composable components. I've also begun making heavy use of <a href="http://www.ramdajs.com">Ramda</a> recently which is an amazing toolkit of functions that brings a functional programming flavor to JavaScript with minimal effort.</p></div><div class="footer"><div class="container"></div></div><!--load scripts--><script src="/javascripts/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/javascripts/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/javascripts/index.js"></script></body></html>
