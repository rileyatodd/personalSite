<p>Even before I started programming I&#39;ve always been a fan of hotkeys, wether in games or any other program like Excel. I remember spending hours agonizing over the ideal hotkey setup for each of my World of Warcraft characters. The reason hotkeys appealed to me so much was that they were efficient. I hated when I wanted to react to something quickly but the reaction I wanted wasn&#39;t already engrained in my muscle memory.</p>
<p>Now that I am a full time software engineer I feel even more justified in finding the perfect combination of keyboard layout and hotkeys. Spending 8 hours a day at a computer makes you yearn for more efficient ways to use it. When I first learned about vi/vim and how fast people could fly around a text file without their hands leaving the home row on the keyboard I knew I had to step my game up.</p>
<p>Initially I learned vim and I&#39;m glad I did because it&#39;s installed everywhere and knowing how to use it proficiently is a super useful skill in my line of work. I found the usability of it pretty lacking though. It wasn&#39;t intuitive, and even today I still find myself looking up cheatsheets when vim isn&#39;t behaving how I want. I knew there had to be a better balance to be struck between raw power and usability, so I set out to hack together my own solution with the following goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must be able to move the cursor around without leaving the home row. I spend a lot of time on laptops and those tiny arrow keys are both horrible and require me to move my hand away from all other useful keys.</li>
<li>It had to be intuitive. I should be able to explain how to use my set up to a non-technical person in under a minute.</li>
<li>It had to be application agnostic. I wanted to be able to move the cursor around in <em>any</em> program I was using, not just my IDE of choice.</li>
</ul>
<p>With these goals in mind I very quickly came to the conclusion that I just needed an extra modifier key, preferably reachable with my thumb, that when pressed would change some of the letter keys to arrow keys.</p>
<p>The setup I landed on was remapping just the <em>right</em> command key (I&#39;m on a mac) to this new modifier. Luckily this is possible and meant I could leave the left command key alone so it would continue to function in it&#39;s normal capacity and I wouldn&#39;t break all the other hotkeys that use it. While the right command key is pressed, <code>i</code>,<code>j</code>,<code>k</code>, and <code>l</code> function as arrow keys much like <code>w</code>, <code>a</code>, <code>s</code>, <code>d</code> in many games.</p>
<p>This setup allows me to move all around most programs without moving my hands off the home row. Helpful things to remember are that on a mac by default holding command (in this case left command) while moving the cursor makes it jump the beginning/end of the line, and holding <code>alt</code> makes the cursor jump word by word.</p>
<p>I used the wonderful tool <a href="https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/">Karabiner</a> for remapping my macbook&#39;s keys (note: this tool doesn&#39;t quite work yet on Sierra unfortunately.) You can find the configuration file I used for this <a href="/misc/karabiner-config.xml">here</a> if you want to give this setup a whirl.</p>
<p>In the end I met all my stated goals although it is not platform agnostic (I couldn&#39;t get a similar mapping to work in windows using AutoHotkey.) However, by remapping things at a hardware level it is possible to get this working without any custom software like Karabiner and on any platform! All you need is a keyboard that supports firmware level remapping and layers. I happen to absolutely LOVE my <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com">ergodox-ez</a> and you can check out my configuration for that <a href="http://configure.ergodox-ez.com/keyboard_layouts/kdvale/">here</a></p>
