Reddit changes vote counts massively.

How much does our perception of things or even our exposure to things change in response to the number we see next to it

Do we need to rethink other sites ranking systems? We should understand that the number next to a post is an arbitrary function upvotes, downvotes, and potentially lots of other factors

Do we need to educate? or have systems with more transparency?
